Hello!

This is a site I'm working on. I call him Dash.

Made because I needed a new portfolio poject to work on as I was job searching,
and because all my previous ones were made on teams with some of my bootcamp mates back in the day and aren't deployed anywhere anymore.

Currently its just a To-do app (boring, maybe but it was necessary, everyone needs one)

I plan on making it more into a personal dashboard thing where maybe there will be a weather widget and a water intake reminder and stuff. We'll see. But anyway

To Install
---

1. Fork & Clone the repo and `cd` into it

2. `cd todos`

3. `npm i`

4. `npm start`

5. Et Voila. It's running. Simple as that.
If anything goes wrong feel free to reach out I'm down to help out always
